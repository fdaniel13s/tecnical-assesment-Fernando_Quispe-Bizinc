## Processes and Challenges

*This section will be updated with the processes and challenges faced during the development of the project.*

- It was complicated to develop some components at frontend, but I managed to solve the problems by researching and asking for help from the community.
- The backend was easier to develop, as I already had experience with Node.js and Sequelize.
- The integration between the frontend and backend was a bit challenging, but I managed to solve it by adjusting the API routes and the frontend components.
- The project structure was well organized, which helped me to develop the project in a more efficient way.
